Hi, Iâ€™m @IsaacSussman! I'm currently learning Rust and Data Structures in Python.

I have experience with Java, Python, C# (in Unity), and a bit of Rust.
I'm interested in game engine development, machine learning, and solving practical, real world problems with code.
I also love doing research (formally, but also just for fun), reading, building Magic: The Gathering decks (that I will never actually get because $$$), and spending time with cool people!

I've previously worked on a project related to the analysis of the physics of cat whiskers with Dr. Ebenstein in the Department of Biomedical Engineering @ Bucknell University, presenting at the 2024 Susquehanna Valley Research Symposium.
Currently, I'm working with Dr. Hopper in the same department to develop a solution for grading concept maps.
